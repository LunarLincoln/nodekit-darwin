NodeKit.io is a cross-platform, cross-javascript-engine runtime solution for Node.js.  

It allows applications developed for node.js to run in the browser, in a desktop client on OS X, or even as a Windows 8.1 Store application.

This is an early preview of the technology and is not intended for production use.

(December 2015) Updated for Swift 2.0.  Master branch contains Node.js v0.12.x (working).   Node.js V4.x branch available work in process.
