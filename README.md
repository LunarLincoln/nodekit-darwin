NodeKit.io is a cross-platform, cross-javascript-engine embedded runtime solution for Node.js that embeds a full Node.js engine inside OS X, iOS, Android, and Windows.

It allows applications developed for node.js to developed once and run without alteration for any of the above platforms as well as in the browser.

This is a refined preview of the technology and is not intended for production use, but is supporting some production app store applications.  Use at your own caution.  Contributions welcome. 

(December 2015) Updated for Swift 2.0 and refactored for iOS and OS X.
Master branch contains Node.js v0.12.x (working).   
Node.js V4.x branch available but not in accelerated development.
