NodeKit.io is a cross-platform, cross-javascript-engine runtime solution for Node.js.  

It allows applications developed for node.js to run in the browser, in a desktop client on OS X, or even as a Windows 8.1 Store application.

This is an early preview of the technology and is not intended for production use.
